# Soft Action Particle Method

This repository provides an implementation for a soft action particle method (SAPM) for continuous action space problems of reinforcement learning. SAPM efficiently reduces the number of parameter of policy network while maintaining the performance.
More detail algorithm can be found in [our paper](http://rllab.snu.ac.kr/publications/papers/2019_iros_sapdrl.pdf). We develope our code based on OpenAI's [spinningup](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/).
